1. Get Computer Choice
    - Create an array containing the Choices (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
    - Use Math.random and Math.floor to generate random ID
    - Use the random ID with the array to get a random item

2. Get User's Choice
    - Use prompt to get user's choice
    - Capitalize user's input before processing it
3. Compare both Choices
    - Test if:
        * Player's input is wrong
        * There is a draw
4. Declare the winner for that play round
    RULE OF GAME
        * Rock beats Scissors
        * Scissors beat Paper
        * Paper beats Rock
5. Create a 5-times loop for the game and declare the real winner for the game.
    - Create function 'game':
    * Use loop to repeat function playround
    * Create variable 'playerScore' to hold number of wins 
    * Create variable 'computerScore' to hold total number of losses
    * If playerScore > computerScore, console.log("You win") else console.log("You lose")
